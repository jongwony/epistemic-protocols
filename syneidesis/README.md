# Syneidesis

Surface potential gaps at decision points (συνείδησις: knowing-together)

> [한국어](./README_ko.md)

## What is Syneidesis?

A modern reinterpretation of Greek συνείδησις (knowing-together) — a protocol that **positions AI as an "auxiliary epistemic agent"**.

### Philosophical Meaning

Transforms the traditional conscience (inner witness) into an externalized dialogue partner. Structures epistemic division of labor — AI handles pattern recognition, humans handle value judgment.

### AI Alignment Perspective

An appropriate human-AI collaboration model for the "weak AI" era. Translates corrigibility into concrete behavioral rules and implements conservative failure modes (waiting on irreversible actions).

### Interaction Design Perspective

A refined implementation of intentional friction. Materializes the epistemic state transition from Unknown Unknowns to Known Unknowns as a UX flow.

## Core Principle

**Surfacing over Deciding**: The goal is not for AI to "make better decisions" but to **"illuminate cognitive blind spots so users can make better decisions"**.

## Usage

```
/syneidesis
```
